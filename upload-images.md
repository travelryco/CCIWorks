# CCIWORKS - Image Upload Instructions

## Current Status
The website is live with colorful gradient placeholders. To show your actual project images, follow these steps:

## Step 1: Prepare Your Images
Save your 5 off-road project photos with these exact filenames:

1. **exhaust-work.jpg** - The metallic exhaust system photo
2. **desert-truck.jpg** - White pickup truck in sand dunes  
3. **suspension-work.jpg** - Blue truck with orange suspension work
4. **land-cruiser.jpg** - Toyota Land Cruiser in natural setting
5. **green-monster.jpg** - Green modified off-road vehicle with large tires

## Step 2: Upload to Repository
1. In your GitHub repository (https://github.com/travelryco/CCIWorks)
2. Navigate to the `images/` folder
3. Upload each image file with the exact filenames above
4. Commit the changes

## Step 3: Automatic Deployment
Vercel will automatically redeploy with your real images once you push to GitHub.

## Image Specifications
- **Format**: JPG or PNG
- **Recommended Size**: 800x600px (4:3 aspect ratio)
- **File Size**: Under 500KB each for fast loading
- **Quality**: High enough to showcase your work professionally

## Alternative: Use Image URLs
If you prefer, I can also update the code to use direct image URLs from any image hosting service.

Let me know if you'd like me to help with either approach!
